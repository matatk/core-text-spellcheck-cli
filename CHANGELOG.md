Change Log
==========

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/matatk/core-text-spellcheck-cli/compare/0.1.0...0.2.0) (2018-01-26)

* Update API to require an initialisation function (so that more complex libraries, can be layered on top, such as in [markdown-spellcheck-cli](https://github.com/matatk/markdown-spellcheck-cli/)).
* Also require an explicit function to actually call up the spell-check on given content (so as to support objects with member functions).
* Update README accordingly.
* Code (scoping, mainly) clean-ups.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/matatk/core-text-spellcheck-cli/tree/0.1.0) (2018-01-26)

* Initial release
